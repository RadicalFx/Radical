# Radical

Radical is an infrastructure framework whose primary role is to help in the development of composite WPF/WP/WinRT applications based on the Model View ViewModel pattern.

In the [documentation](https://github.com/mauroservienti/radical/wiki)  there are a lot of articles that details the Radical concepts and give some guidences on how to use it.

The Radical framework is not tight to WPF/WP/WinRT but some part of it can be freely used, and will be valuable, even in services and web applications.
